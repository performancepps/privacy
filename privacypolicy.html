                                                                          Privacy Policy
By registering or using this application and/or any of our online or mobile products, games and services, you agree to our Privacy Policy and that we may store any of your data, account and device information, for eg: your Google Account - as many of our games require this information for signing in, leaderboards, multiplayer, etc. We assure you that we do not use the same for any illegal activity or to send you emails.
Hence, By registering or using this device, you agree that we may process your data in accordance with the following privacy policy and that you will abide by the following Terms of Service.
There are two types of information we may collect through your use of our Games:

Personal Information which is the type of information that can specifically be linked to you personally, such as your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photograph, location, credit card information and, in some cases, user names; etc

Non-personal Usage Data which is anonymous data about your use of the Websites/Apps that is tied to your computer and/or device through which you use the Websites/Apps.
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, to the home page or other places so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material or significant changes to this policy or the way we use your childï¿½s information, we will notify you or the parent/guardian here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the changes taking effect. Your continued use of our online and mobile products and services will signify your acceptance of the changes to our online Privacy Policy.

Certain of our Websites/Apps may permit in-game purchases, even if the applicable game was free to download. Such purchases do not always require the re-entry of credit card information because they may be made through an existing third-party account (such as an Gmail account). If you are a parent who is concerned about this feature, you may disable the ability to make in-game purchases by selecting the Settings tab for the applicable Website/App, and following the necessary prompts to prohibit such purchases. If you are between the age of 13 and 18, please obtain your parents permission prior to registering with our Platform or providing us with any Personal Information.

We respect your right to privacy. Any personal information that you share with us, like your name, date of birth, address, marital status, telephone number, credit card particulars and the like, shall be entitled to privacy and kept confidential. If you choose to purchase a product from our Websites/Apps, you represent and warrant that all credit card information you provide will be accurate and correct and that you are authorized to use such credit card. In no event will you provide us with any false or fraudulent information. We will not sell, rent or transfer your Personal Information to third parties, except as otherwise indicated herein. We will not store your credit card information. In order to process credit card payments, we will use the service of a secure, third-party credit card processor.

We use the services of third parties who will have limited access to your Personal Information to be used for specific purposes. These purposes may include credit card processing, prize delivery, marketing assistance, customer service, and data analysis. The third parties we contract with for these purposes will be authorized to use your Personal Information only for the purposes for which the party was engaged. In addition, Usage Data in aggregated, anonymous form may be shared with third parties who assist us with our internal operations such as administration, analytics, research, and optimization.

We may disclose your Personal Information or other information collected if required by law or court order, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct, to investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Websites/Apps, or to protect the property or safety of others.

In connection with any sale of our company or any line of business (including the assets relating thereto), customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and such customer information (including your Personal Information) will be transferred or sold to the acquirer in the event of any such sale or disposition of any or all of our business.
